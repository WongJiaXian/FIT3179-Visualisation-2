        <h1>Chocolates Around the World</h1>
        <p>Chocolates are one of the most desired foods in the world. There exists different variants of chocolate, 
            each made and sourced from different parts of the world. This visualisation plans to look at them in detail.</p>

            <h2>Bean Origin & Manufacturing Location</h2>
            <p>Chocolates' main ingredient, cocoa beans, can be found natively in many countries. However, due to
                several factors such as climate, soil, cultivation methods, etc, the chocolates that the beans are made
                into can vary wildly in taste and quality.
            </p>
            <p> Manufacturing chocolates on the other hand, depends more on an area's culture and technological advances.
                For example, different cultures have different ways of processing cocoa beans, some more effective than
                others, and some can produce unique flavors. Technology also plays a part in a country's chocolate quality.
                More advanced technology can produce new kinds of chocolate, or refine previous iterations of chocolate.

          <h2>Cocoa Percentage</h2>
          <p>All different chocolates share similar ingredients, yet each has its own unique flavor profile. The main
            factor is due to the amount of cocoa used for each chocolate. While people has varying preferences, majority
            prefers moderately high amount of cocoa in their chocolate, as too much can make chocolates bitter, or risk
            overpowering the cocoa flavor with other ingredients if too little cocoa was used.

          <h2>Number of Ingredients</h2>
          <p>Each chocolate not only varies in cocoa percentage, they also vary in the number of ingredients used.
            Cocoa's distinctive flavor can be complimented by a variety of foods to produce wildly different unique
            flavors. All the possible recipes of chocolate are delicious in their own way, but many can agree some 
            recipes are better than others.  </p>

                <h2>Amount of Chocolate in the World</h2>
                <p>Chocolates are very popular among people, but they aren't easy to make on your own. Companies around the 
                  world have tried to make a profit out of making and selling their own brand of chocolate with varying degree
                  of success. In the above graph, it can be seen that some countries produce more chocolates than others. This 
                  could be due to difference in local demand, technological accessability (how easy it is for competitors to aquire
                  machinery needed) and many more factors.  
                </p>    
                  <p>Furthermore, companies also have preferences on where they source their cocoa beans. Even though each cocoa bean
                  from each country is unique in their own way, companies discovered the majority of the population prefer beans
                  from specific countries. Moreover, some countries also lack the abilty to grow and cultivate a variety of beans
                  due to climate and other factors.
